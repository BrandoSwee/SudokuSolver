# SudokuSolver
This python sudoku solver uses constraint satisfaction and naked doubles to solve sudoku boards.
If the board needs more than naked doubles alone, it will take a guess and go until it finds a solution or needs to backtrack and guess a different value.  If all possible guesses are made and it canâ€™t fall back on a previous guess, it will say the board is unsolvable.  

## Improvements for others to make
Adding other logic for things like triplets will help the program do tasks faster.
Making other board input types could be another possible addition.
